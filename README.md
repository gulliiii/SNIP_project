# SNIP Project

This is a project I had to do for an advanced deep learning course from the Postgraduate Master's in "Mathematical and Physical Methods in Space Sciences and Industrial Applications" at the University of Turin. The task was to reproduce the experiments carried out in the paper "SNIP: SINGLE-SHOT NETWORK PRUNING BASED ON CONNECTION SENSITIVITY" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1VZqjAcYX), studing a pruning method which has to be performed only once at inizialization.
